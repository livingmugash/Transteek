Technology Selection & Justification
Component	Technology	Justification
Real-time Communication	WebSockets or gRPC	For our backend, WebSockets offer a great balance of performance and simplicity for bidirectional, real-time audio streaming. gRPC, another excellent option, is often used for high-performance microservices communication. We'll proceed with WebSockets for this PoC due to its widespread support and ease of use.
Speech-to-Text	Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (Streaming)	This is the industry standard for real-time transcription. Its ability to provide interim results is the cornerstone of our low-latency strategy. It allows us to start the translation process before a speaker has even finished their sentence.
Machine Translation	Google Cloud Translation API	A highly accurate and fast translation service. It's a simple REST API call, making it easy to integrate.
Text-to-Speech	Google Cloud Text-to-Speech	We'll use WaveNet voices for their unparalleled naturalness, which is key to a good user experience. We will need to carefully manage the trade-off between voice quality and the small amount of latency the synthesis process adds.
Backend Hosting	Google Cloud Run	Cloud Run is a serverless platform that's perfect for our needs. It automatically scales up or down (even to zero), so we only pay for what we use. It's ideal for event-driven, containerized applications like our translation agent.
